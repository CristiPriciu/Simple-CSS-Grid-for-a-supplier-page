# Simple-CSS-Grid-for-a-supplier-page

With a Saas eCommerce platform like Merchant Pro is harder to add a grid like bootstrap. CSS Grid is good because it comes with all browsers and can be used anywhere.

Also in this project, inline CSS is useful because in Merchant Pro we cannot easily modify internal or external CSS. Even in Merchant Pro Next, its more easy and safe this way, for small pages.
